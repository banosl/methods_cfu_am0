# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
```
Pretty confident. It's helpful to have the site with the list of methods so I can try them out.
```
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
```
Good, going through the simple methods exercises helped put a flow to how to do it.
```
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
```
Frankly, I'm not confident I understand what implicit and explicit returns are. In the final practice I was only able to us the puts function which always has a return value of nil. I don't fully get why. The act of making and using methods is there for me, but I'm missing a piece here.
